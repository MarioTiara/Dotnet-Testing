# Learning Unit Test on Dotnet Using Xunit

Unit testing is one of important skill that developers should have, because it will define how well the software is. Basically unit test is one of testing method in which focosing on testing the individual compenents of software. This repo is my self learning documentation which I get from several online course and free tutorials.

## The testing skills has been cracked are:
### 1. Assert
  - The Assert Phase
  - Asserting numeric values
  - Asserting string values
  - Asserting boolean values as well as null values
  - Asserting Collections
  - Asserting a range of values
  - Asserting Exceptions
  - Asserting object types
2. Arrange Phase, and Managing Tests
  - Collections and Traits
  - Class Fixtures and IClassFixture
  - Constructors and IDisposable
  - Collection Definition
  - Parallel Execution of Tests
3. Data Driven Test
  - Data Driven Tests in XUnit .net and the "Theory" attribute
  - Passing parameters to unit tests with inline attributes
  - Sharing test data across multiple unit test methods
  - Passing parameters to unit tests from external resources
  - Sharing test data across multiple unit test methods with custom attributes
4. Mocking Test
